### R-programing language
My work using R-studio

```markdown

# Vizualizing code using ggplot2


## To create a visualization plot between body_mass_g & bill_depth_mm
## by loading ggplot2 & palmerpenguins package

library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
data("penguins")
View(penguins)

ggplot(data= penguins) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x= bill_depth_mm , y= body_mass_g))

## Plot show a positive relationhip between two points
#___________________

## adding a color for a detailed view for better understanding  of different species

ggplot(data = penguins) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x=bill_depth_mm, y = body_mass_g, color= body_mass_g))

## to add a color and shape for more detailed understanding of different species

ggplot(data = penguins) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x=bill_depth_mm, y = body_mass_g, color= species, shape= species))

## now i want to view same data using a line graph plot 
#along with the correlation between the species

ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=bill_depth_mm, y = body_mass_g, color= species, shape= species)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=bill_depth_mm, y = body_mass_g, color= species, shape= species))




## now i will work using a bar graph to work with diamonds dataset

ggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=cut))

ggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=cut, color=cut))

## to differenciate the bar chart by color 

ggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=cut, fill = cut))


## to display subset of my data and smaller group
## to create a separate plot for each species

ggplot(data = penguins)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=bill_depth_mm, y = body_mass_g))+
  facet_wrap(~species)

## to create a separate plot for each species and add a color to differenciate the plots

ggplot(data=penguins, aes(x=bill_depth_mm, y= body_mass_g))+
  geom_point(aes(color= species))+
  facet_wrap(~species)

```
## Using R programing to understand DATA FRAME

```markdown

## Data frame
## as an data analyst having proper knowledge about data frame is imp.

#we need to instal ggplot2 package 

install.packages("ggplot2")
library("ggplot2")
data("diamonds")
View(diamonds)

## diamonds dataframe has 53940 rows and 10 variables

## -------------------------------------------------------------

## But i want to view only the first 6 columns from the data frame
## so i have to use head() function

head(diamonds)

## now i want to summarize the data frame to collect some more insights
## to view only the column names by using colnames() function

colnames(diamonds)


# now i want to clean my data frame
## for which ineed to install (here, skimr, janitor, dplyr) functions

install.packages("here")
library(here)

install.packages("skimr")
library(skimr)

install.packages("janitor")
library(janitor)

install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

```
